# Multi-dimensional Gated Recurrent Units
This repository contains the code used to produce the results in the papers **Automated Segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis Lesions using Multi-Dimensional Gated Recurrent Units** and **Multi-dimensional Gated Recurrent Units for Automated Anatomical Landmark Localization**. The code was written by Simon Andermatt except for the orientation correction of NIftI files which was provided by Simon Pezold. It was used to reach *1st place* in the ISBI 2015 longitudinal lesion segmentation challenge, *2nd place* in the white matter hyperintensities challenge of MICCAI 2017 and its previous implementation in CAFFE made *3rd place* in the MrBrainS13 Segmentation challenge. We also competed in BraTS 2017, where the information on the exact rank are still unknown. 
This release is implemented using the tensorflow framework. The CAFFE code is not maintained anymore (there are probably breaking changes in CuDNN, not tested), but a snapshot of it is included in this release in the folder tensorflow_extra_ops as additional operation for tensorflow. 
Since being published, the code has been improved on quite a bit, especially to facilitate handling training and testing runs. The reported results should still be reproducible though using this implementation.
# How to Use
The file *RUN_mdgru.py* is used for basically all segmentation tasks. For now, please refer to it's help message by calling *python3 RUN_mdgru.py* and the documentation in the code. Some use cases will be documented here in detail at some later point in time. The code for the landmark localization task is also included in this release except for an appropriate *RUN*-file. Since it would need some code updates due to recent changes in the code, it has not been included. If you're anyhow interested in the localization code, please get in touch, and I could provide you with the (now outdated) *RUN*-files we used and information on what needs to be updated to make it work again. 
## Requirements
Requirements (on ubuntu) can be installed using the following lines of code. On other systems, use the corresponding packages.

```
sudo apt-get install cmake python3-pip curl git python3-dicom

sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip

# either with a gpu, and cuda + cudnn installed:
sudo pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
# or
sudo pip3 install tensorflow

pip3 install nibabel numpy scipy matplotlib pynrrd scikit-image scikit-learn

```

When using this code, please cite at least *andermatt2016multi*, since it is the foundation of this work. Furthermore, feel free to cite the publication matching your use-case from above. E.g. if you're using the code for pathology segmentation, it would be adequate to cite *andermatt2017a* as well.
